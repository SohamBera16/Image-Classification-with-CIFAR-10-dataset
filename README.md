# Image-Classification-with-CIFAR-10-dataset
creating different data pipelines along with a Neural Network model for object detection in the CIFAR-10 dataset and comparing the model performance with a baseline model performance 

## Project requirements and configuration used:
1) Python version 3.6 or higher (used: Python 3.7.14)
2) PyTorch version 1.4 or higher 
3) Torchvision version 0.8 or higher 
4) NumPy version 1.16 or higher 
5) Matplotlib version 3.0 or higher 

## Project Objective: 
To achieve a detection accuracy of greater than 70% for 10 different object categories in the CIFAR-10 image dataset containing a total of 60000 images of 32 by 32 pixel size by using various deep learning technologies based on neural networks e.g. dense neural networks, Convolutional neural networks, Transfer Learning, etc.
